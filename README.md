# CarProfiles

This is a online racing platform that allows users to race each other and climb the ranking system.
This is sort of a "tinder for racing" concept.This application doesn't have a secure authentication system or a secure session  system(the current version) , 
since this is meant to be a skeleton of a larger/more effective web application to come!! 70% of the client-server functionality is complete.
This application is very responsive accomplished using websockets and real-time server updates.(Client,Server and CSS need to be modularized).

# To run this locally:
- run `node server.js`
- spin up MongoDb
- connect to `http://localhost:8020/`
