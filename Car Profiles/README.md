This is a online racing platform that allows users to race each other and climb the ranking system.This is sort of a "tinder for racing" concept.This application doesn't have a secure authentication system or a secure session  system(the current version) , since this is meant to be a skeleton of a larger/more effective web application to come!! 70% of the client-server functionality is complete.This application is very responsive accomplished using websockets and real-time server updates.The client and server is written in javascript with the help of node and express.
